# HyparDrive

## Introduction
HyparDrive is the drive software for the Hypar installation made by Team IGNITE for GLOW Eindhoven 2019. This software is created by the IGNITE programming team, with Lead Programmer Joris Lodewijks. A [development vlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aMt1voKEiOnQGPngewUEA) showing concepting and building of the system is uploaded.

### Dependencies
The structure of the software is dependent on the ELM software from ENNTECH. For integrating interaction and music outputting, speakers and interaction modules will need to be connected.

### Installation Controller
The Installation Controller is the main part of the software. This static class connects every part of the system and makes all the decisions. Other classes give or receive requests from this class.
