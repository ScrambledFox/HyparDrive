# HyparDrive

## Introduction
HyparDrive is the drive software for the Hypar installation made by Team IGNITE for GLOW Eindhoven 2019. This software is created by the IGNITE programming team, with Lead Programmer Joris Lodewijks. A [development vlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aMt1voKEiOnQGPngewUEA) showing concepting and building of the system will be uploaded.

## Structure
### Functionality
HyparDrive is the driving software for the Hypar installation made by the IGNITE team for GLOW 2019. This driving software is to be adapted for use with other installations, but the current main focus is making it as best as possible for our installation. 

### Specifics
The LED data is sent via Art-Net, a DMX via Ethernet Protocol. Integration for interaction and soundscape outputting will be supported as well, but only adapted for the Hypar installation. Support for custom installations will follow.
